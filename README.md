# CRISpy
This is my personal code library where I share (hopefully) useful python tools. 
Originally the module was created to work with SST data, but most of that functionality is now part of the [ISPy](https://github.com/ISP-SST/ISPy/tree/master) library and maintained there.

The code is under constant development and shared publicly 'as is', however bug reports are encouraged.
